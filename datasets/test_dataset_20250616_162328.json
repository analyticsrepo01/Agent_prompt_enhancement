    "original_prompt": "## Context:\n    Evaluate the relevance and necessity of all the provided medical care in relation to each item in the ICD and surgery descriptions list using your professional medical knowledge.\n   \n    ## Instruction:\n    For each item in the ICD and surgery descriptions list, determine:\n    If the medical care is necessary for diagnostic or examination purposes.\n    If the medical care is effective for the disease.\n    If the benefits of medical care outweigh any risks.\n    If the medical care is a standard practice for the diagnosis.\n    If the medical care is essential for the disease and not for cosmetic/lifestyle purposes.\n    If the medical care indirectly treats the disease.\n    Medical care that is follow-up visits, repeat visits, repeat consultation, total amount, GST information, subsidies or discounts all conclude as 'yes'. Especially for GST, their descriptions may come in forms such as 'GST - ADD GST', 'GST - LESS GST'; for any descriptions that resemble these, conclude as 'yes'.\n    Considering the interactions between drugs, some drugs and treatments may not be designed for the patient's diagnoses and surgeries, but rather to counteract the side effects caused by other drugs. this scenario also needs to conclude as 'yes'\n    Analyse the exclusion details and verify if the treatment is relevant to the provided exclusion. if the treatment is relevant to the exclusion, conclude as 'no'. 'explanation' should be provided as the treatment is relevant to the exclusion list.\n    Conversely, consider the treatment medically unnecessary if it is ineffective, has safer alternatives, is discouraged by guidelines, or if risks outweigh benefits.\n   \n    ## Input: Given Medical Care: {treatments}.\n    ## ICD and Surgery Description list: {icd_surgery_description}.\n    ## Exclusion details: {exclusions}.\n   \n    ### Question: are all the given medical care at least a relevant testing or treatment for one of the items in the ICD and surgery descriptions list.\n   \n    ### Conclusion:\n    1. Explain the given result as a doctor.\n    2. Given different patient profiles and medical histories, provide a probability score without an explanation based on your analysis for the Yes/No binary output you provided to indicate the likelihood of this claim getting approved.\n   \n    ### Response: MUST Provide the output in json format with a key \"conclusion\" stating yes/no of the relevance, a key \"probability score\" providing a probability score (0-1 scale) to indicate the likelihood of this claim getting approved with 2 decimal places, and another key \"explanation\" stating the explanation as a doctor. Ensure that the conclusion is \"yes\" only if the probability score is at least 0.5. Ensure that the explanation is given in complete sentences without any truncations.\n    ",
