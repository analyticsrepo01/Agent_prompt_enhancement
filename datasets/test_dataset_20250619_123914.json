Given different patient profiles and medical histories, provide a probability score without an explanation based on your analysis for the Yes/No binary output you provided to indicate the likelihood of this claim getting approved.\n   \n    ### Response:\nMUST Provide the output in json format with a key \"conclusion\" stating yes/no of the relevance, a key \"probability score\" providing a probability score (0-1 scale) to indicate the likelihood of this claim getting approved with 2 decimal places, and another key \"explanation\" to explain the relevance of this PP visit as a doctor. Ensure that the conclusion is \"yes\" only if the probability score is at least 0.5. Ensure that the explanation is given in complete sentences without any truncations.\n    ",
