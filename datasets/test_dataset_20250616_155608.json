      "probability score": 0.95,
      "explanation": "Amoxicillin is a standard antibiotic treatment for acute bacterial sinusitis. It is effective in resolving the infection and alleviating symptoms. The benefits of treatment outweigh the risks of potential side effects like nausea or diarrhea. It is essential for treating the infection and not related to cosmetic or lifestyle purposes.

While long-term opioid therapy is often discouraged, the short-term use of oxycodone for severe post-operative pain is generally considered appropriate. The benefits of pain relief outweigh the risks of short-term side effects when used as directed. This is a standard practice following surgery and directly addresses pain."
